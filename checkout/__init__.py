# we need to tell django the name of the default config class for the app
# which is checkout.apps.CheckoutConfig.
# You may remember this class from apps.py where we imported our signals module.
# Without this line in the innit file, django wouldn't know about our
# custom ready method so our signals wouldn't work.
