# So our form is being submitted and orders are successfully created in the database.
# But what happens if the users somehow intentionally or accidentally
# closes the browser window after the payment is confirmed but before the form is submitted.
# We would end up with a payment in stripe but no order in our database.
# What's more, if we were building a real store that needed to complete
# post order operations like fulfilment sending internal email notifications and so on
# none of that stuff would be triggered because the user never fully completed their order.
# This could result in a customer being charged and never receiving a confirmation email
# or even worse never receiving what they ordered.
# To prevent this situation we're going to build in some redundancy.
# Each time an event occurs on stripe such as a payment intent being created.
# A payment being completed and so on stripe sends out what's called a webhook we can listen for.
# Webhooks are like the signals django sends each time a model is saved or deleted.
# Except that they're sent securely from stripe to a URL we specify.
# To handle these webhooks we're going to create our first custom class.

# The init method of the class is a setup method that's called every time an instance of the class is created.
# For us we're going to use it to assign the request as an attribute of the class
# just in case we need to access any attributes of the request coming from stripe.
# Now I'll create a class method called handle event which will take the event stripe is sending us
# and simply return an HTTP response indicating it was received.
